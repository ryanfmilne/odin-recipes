    <h2>Chef Ryan's Banana Bread</h2>
    <p>This banana bread by Chef John is spiked with dark chocolate chips and walnuts. Banana bread is one of those things people rarely make on purpose â€” only when those last 3 bananas are almost black. However, this scrumptious loaf is so good you'll want to make it well before the bananas reach that condition.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>cooking spray</li>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Coat a 9x4-inch loaf pan with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl; set aside.</li>
            <li>Beat together sugar and butter with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Add mashed bananas and mix until combined. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in milk and vanilla.</li>
            <li>Stir in flour mixture, walnuts, and chocolate chips until just incorporated. Pour batter into the prepared loaf pan. Tap pan on the counter to release any air pockets.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour and 10 minutes. Let rest in the pan for 15 to 20 minutes. Remove bread from the pan, then slice and serve.</li>
        </ol>
